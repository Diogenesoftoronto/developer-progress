# Testing and Benchmarking 
my results for Leetcode Questions through both my costum functions will be put here.
## Files
The files for each function will be stored here. The test function that I will create will create a directory with the function being passed in and then store the results of that test in this directory. That way I will have a record of my performance in a directory and it will give me practice with manipulating, creating, and using files and data in javascript! 
## Potential
There is the potential to even store the performance results to a SQL database that will allow me to query it and analyze my performance that way.
